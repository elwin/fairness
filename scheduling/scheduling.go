// For that we let all threads queue up after each iteration randomly (as opposed to stay in queue).
// If the output is once again evenly distributed this suggests it is not a FIFO queue, instead having
// state that keeps track of each routine. If the output is roughly evenly distributed but seems to contain
// randomness (e.g. Æ’ollowing a gaussian normal distribution), this suggests that a FIFO could have been used.
